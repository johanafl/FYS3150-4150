# Fys3150/4150
This repository contains the work on projects in the UiO course Computational Physics (Fys3150/4150) by Mats Ola Sand, Jon Kristian Dal and Johan Andreas Fl√∏isand. The course consits of five projects, and thus five different directories, each containing our solution to the respective project. 

The repository will be updated as the course progresses.

The directory called test_cpp is a temporary directory which will be used to test different functionality in C++. It is not part of the different projects.
