# Project 1 - Introduction to C++ and linear algebra problems in Computational Physics

We begin the course by studying how we can solve the Poisson differential equation using matricies and vector algebra. Spesificly, we will use the Thomas algorithm, a spesialized verison of the Thomas algorithm and LU decomposition to solve the problem. Since all of the above algorithms can be quite computationaly heavy, we will use the programming language C++ to to do the actual calculation and Python to visualize it. 

We will also write a report on this exersice. This report will be written as if it was not an exersice and instead as an actual scientiffic report.
